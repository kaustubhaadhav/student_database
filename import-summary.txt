Android Student Information System Project Import Summary  
=======================================

Ignored Files:  
--------------  
The following files were not copied into the new Gradle project. Please review whether these files are still required for your project, and if so, move them manually:

- ic_launcher-web.png  
- proguard-project.txt  

Replaced Jars with Dependencies:  
--------------------------------  
The following .jar files were identified as third-party libraries and replaced with Gradle dependencies. This allows better version control and easier updates. However, the version used might differ from the one in your project, potentially causing build issues. You can disable this automatic replacement during import if needed:

- android-support-v4.jar => com.android.support:support-v4:18.0.0  

Moved Files:  
------------  
The Android Student Information System, developed using the Android SDK and Java, utilizes SQLite for local data storage. The project files were restructured during the import to Gradle, as the Android Gradle project follows a different directory structure compared to the ADT Eclipse project. The file changes are as follows:

- AndroidManifest.xml => app\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml  
- assets\ => app\src\main\assets  
- res\ => app\src\main\res\  
- src\ => app\src\main\java\

Next Steps:  
-----------  
You can now build the project using Gradle. Ensure network connectivity is available for Gradle to download necessary dependencies and libraries. The SQLite integration remains unchanged, providing efficient local data management for the Android application.

Bugs:  
-----  
If you encounter any issues related to the import process or notice that the project does not compile due to the transition from Eclipse to Gradle, please file a bug at http://b.android.com under Component-Tools.
